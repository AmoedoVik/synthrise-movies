SynthriseMovies is a movie platform. To access it, you just need to create an account on the login page with a valid email and a random password. Then you will choose a plan, you will be forwarded to a payment page (strype) there you can put random data like ''test, test, test'' and a test credit card number like ''4242 4242 4242 4242 4242 '' then you can access the platform, create your own favorites list and enjoy the trailers! :D
